# OIBSIP_Level-1_Task-1_Landing-Page
Demo Landing Page


Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Visual Studio Code, I created a Landing Page Website. The website is designed for an academy called "Academy of Excellence," which offers job-ready technical courses such as Python, Data Science, and Web Development. The website also highlights an ongoing offer in these courses.

The website has a modern and professional design that reflects the academy's brand and style. It features four main sections - Home, About, Mentor, and Sign Up. The Home section provides an introduction to the academy and the courses it offers, while the About section gives more information about the academy and its mission. The Mentor section highlights the experienced mentors who teach the courses, while the Sign Up section allows visitors to register for the courses.

One of the unique features of this Landing Page Website is the inclusion of student reviews on the courses. This section allows visitors to read about the experiences of past students and learn more about the quality and value of the courses.

I utilised HTML to structure the information, CSS to design the interface and make it aesthetically appealing, and JavaScript to integrate interactive elements like a responsive menu and a contact form on this website.

For this project, I used Microsoft Studio Code as my IDE of choice, which allowed me to create and edit code rapidly and effectively. The website is responsive, which means it adjusts to multiple screen sizes and devices, allowing users to view it through desktops, laptops, tablets, or smartphones.
